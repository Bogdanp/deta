@title{@exec{deta}: Functional Database Mapping}
@man:author[(author+email "Bogdan Popa" "bogdan@defn.io")]

@defmodule[deta]

@(define (repo-link label)
   (hyperlink "https://github.com/Bogdanp/deta" label))

This library automatically maps database tables to Racket structs and
lets you perform CRUD operations and arbitrary queries on them. Sort of
like an ORM.

The API is currently stable, but small things may change before 1.0.
Watch the @repo-link{GitHub repository} if you want to stay on top of
potential changes.


@section[#:tag "principles"]{Principles}

The main principle behind this library is "explicitness without tedium."
By that I mean that it should be clear to someone who is reading code
that uses this library how that code maps to database operations, while
making the common cases of mapping data between database tables and
Racket structs straightforward and simple.

@subsection{Non-goals}

@itemlist[
  @item{@bold{Support for every SQL dialect.}  Despite the fact that
        both SQLite and PostgreSQL are currently supported by this
        library, the focus is on PostgreSQL and SQLite just serves as
        a check to ensure that nothing is @emph{too} PostgreSQL
        specific.}
  @item{@bold{Being a general purpose SQL DSL}.  For some queries you
        may have to resort to raw SQL or the @tt{sql} library.  deta
        is very much an "80% solution."}
  @item{@bold{Being externally-extensible.}  The SQL AST as well as
        all of the dialect code is considered private and any new
        dialects (such as MySQL) will have to be added to the library
        itself.}
]

If you're down with that, then, by all means, carry on and read the
tutorial!


@section[#:tag "versus"]{Compared to ...}

@subsection{Racquel}

Racquel takes a more classic approach to database mapping by being a
real ORM. It is based on the class system, with entities backed by
mutable objects and with support for associations via lazy loading.
Deta's approach is the opposite of this by focusing on working with
immutable structs, avoiding associations and any sort of lazy behavior
altogether.

@subsection{sql}

The @tt{sql} library is great at statically generating SQL queries. The
problem is that the generated queries are not composable at runtime.
You have to write macros to compose them and I've found that that gets
tedious quickly.

On top of giving you composable queries -- as you can hopefully see
from the tutorial --, deta also automatically maps CRUD operations to
structs, which is out of scope for @tt{sql}.


@section[#:tag "tutorial"]{Tutorial}

@; Blatantly copied from sql-lib!
@(begin
   (define-syntax-rule (interaction e ...) (examples #:label #f e ...))
   (define-runtime-path log-file "tutorial-log.rktd")
   (define log-mode (if (getenv "DETA_RECORD") 'record 'replay))
   (define (make-pg-eval log-file)
     (define ev (make-log-based-eval log-file log-mode))
     (begin0 ev
       (ev '(require racket/contract racket/match racket/string threading
                     (for-label db gregor)))))
   (define db-eval (make-pg-eval log-file)))

deta builds upon the @racketmodname[db] library.  You will use deta to
generate your mappings and create queries, but the db library will be
doing the actual work of talking to the database and handling
transactions.

Let's start by creating a database connection in the usual way:

@interaction[
#:eval db-eval
(require db)

(code:line)
(define conn
  (postgresql-connect #:database "deta"
                      #:user     "deta"
                      #:password "deta"))
]

Next, let's define a schema for books:

@interaction[
#:eval db-eval
(require deta)

(code:line)
(define-schema book
  ([id id/f #:primary-key #:auto-increment]
   [title string/f #:contract non-empty-string? #:wrapper string-titlecase]
   [author string/f #:contract non-empty-string?]
   [published-on date/f]))
]

The above generates a struct named @racket[book] with fields for the
table's @racket[id], @racket[title], @racket[author] and @racket[published-on]
columns, an associated ``smart constructor'' called @racket[make-book]
and functional setter and updater functions for each field.

@interaction[
#:eval db-eval
(require gregor)

(code:line)
(define a-book
  (make-book #:title "To Kill a Mockingbird"
             #:author "Harper Lee"
             #:published-on (date 1960 7 11)))

(code:line)
(book-id a-book)
(book-title a-book)
(book-title
 (update-book-title a-book (lambda (t)
                             (string-append t "?"))))

(code:line)
(code:comment "schema entities are immutable so the above did not change a-book")
(book-title a-book)
]

We can use the schema to issue DDL commands to the database and create
the table:

@interaction[
#:eval db-eval
#:hidden
(drop-table! conn 'book)
]

@interaction[
#:eval db-eval
(create-table! conn 'book)
]

@(define north-uri "https://docs.racket-lang.org/north/index.html")
@margin-note{While the DDL functionality is convenient for the
purposes of this tutorial, in real world projects you should probably
use something like @hyperlink[north-uri]{north} to manage your
database schema.}

Now that we have a table, we can insert the book that we created into
the database:

@interaction[
#:eval db-eval
(define saved-book
  (insert-one! conn a-book))

(code:line)
(book-id saved-book)
]

Let's insert a few more books:

@interaction[
#:eval db-eval
(void
 (insert! conn (make-book #:title "1984"
                          #:author "George Orwell"
                          #:published-on (date 1949 6 8))
               (make-book #:title "The Lord of the Rings"
                          #:author "J.R.R. Tolkien"
                          #:published-on (date 1954 7 29))
               (make-book #:title "The Catcher in the Rye"
                          #:author "J.D. Salinger"
                          #:published-on (date 1949 7 16))))
]

And now let's query for all of the books published before 1955:

@interaction[
#:eval db-eval
(require threading)

(code:line)
(for/list ([b (in-entities conn (~> (from book #:as b)
                                    (where (< b.published-on (date "1955-01-01")))
                                    (order-by ([b.published-on #:desc]))))])
  (book-title b))
]

Sweet!  Here's the query we just ran:

@interaction[
#:eval db-eval
(displayln
 (~> (from book #:as b)
     (where (< b.published-on (date "1955-01-01")))
     (order-by ([b.published-on #:desc]))))
]

What about dynamic parameters, you may ask?  Let's wrap the above
query in a function:

@interaction[
#:eval db-eval
(define (books-before year)
  (~> (from book #:as b)
      (where (< b.published-on ,(sql-date year 1 1)))
      (order-by ([b.published-on #:desc]))))

(code:line)
(for/list ([b (in-entities conn (books-before 1950))])
  (book-title b))

(code:line)
(for/list ([b (in-entities conn (books-before 1955))])
  (book-title b))
]

Any time the query combinators encounter an @racket[unquote], that
value gets replaced with a placeholder node in the query AST and, when
the query is eventually executed, the value is bound to its prepared
statement.  This makes it safe and easy to parameterize your queries
without having to worry about SQL injection attacks.

Oftentimes, you'll want to query data from the DB that doesn't match
your schema. For example, let's say we want to grab the number of books
published by year from our database. To do that, we can declare a
@deftech{virtual schema} -- one whose entities can't be persisted -- and
project our queries onto that schema.

@interaction[
#:eval db-eval
(define-schema book-stats
  #:virtual
  ([year date/f]
   [books integer/f]))

(code:line)
(define books-published-by-year
  (~> (from book #:as b)
      (select (as
                (cast (date_trunc "year" b.published-on) date)
                year)
              (count b.title))
      (group-by year)
      (order-by ([year]))
      (project-onto book-stats-schema)))

(code:line)
(for ([s (in-entities conn books-published-by-year)])
  (displayln (format "year: ~a books: ~a"
                     (book-stats-year s)
                     (book-stats-books s))))
]

If we hadn't wrapped our query with @racket[project-onto], then the
data would've been returned as @racket[values] which we could
destructure inside the @racket[for] loop, exactly like
@racket[in-query] from @racketmodname[db].

It's time to wind things down so let's delete all the books published
before 1950:

@interaction[
#:eval db-eval
(query-exec conn (delete (books-before 1950)))
]

Re-run the last query to make sure it worked:

@interaction[
#:eval db-eval
(for ([s (in-entities conn books-published-by-year)])
  (displayln (format "year: ~a books: ~a"
                     (book-stats-year s)
                     (book-stats-books s))))
]

That's all there is to it.  You now know the basics of deta.  Thanks

@subsubsection{Query Expressions}

@centered{
  @racketgrammar*[
    #:literals (array as and case else fragment list not or quote subquery unquote unquote-splicing)

    [q-expr (and q-expr ...+)
            (array q-expr ...)
            (as q-expr id)
            (case [q-expr q-expr] ...+)
            (case [q-expr q-expr] ...+

            number
            app]

    [app (q-expr q-expr ...)]

    [ident symbol]]
}

The grammar for @deftech{query expressions}.

Tuples are created using the @racket[(list 1 2 3)] or @racket['(1 2 3)] syntax:

@interaction[
  #:eval reference-eval
  (select _ (in 1 '(1 2 3 4)))
  (select _ (in 1 (list 1 2 3 4)))
]

Dynamic lists can be turned into tuples using the @racket[,@(list 1 2 3)] syntax:

@interaction[
  #:eval reference-eval
  (let ([xs (list 1 2 3)])
    (select _ (in 1 ,@(map add1 xs))))
]

Note that the splicing syntax splices scalar lists directly into the
query so you @emph{must be careful} when using it in conjunction with
untrusted user input.

Arrays are created using the @racket[(array 1 2 3)] syntax:

@interaction[
  #:eval reference-eval
  (select _ (array-concat (array 1 2) (array 3 4)))
]

Various operators have built-in support and generate queries
predictably. Operator names are always lower-case so @racket[(in a b)]
is valid, while @racket[(IN a b)] is not. If you find an operator that
you need doesn't produce the query you expect, then open an issue on
GitHub and I'll fix it as soon as I can.

Within a query expression, the following identifiers are treated
specially by the base (i.e. PostgreSQL) dialect. These are inherited by
other dialects, but using them with those dialects may result in invalid
queries.

          [pre-delete-hook (-> entity? entity?)])]{

  Defines a schema named @racket[id].  The schema will have an
  associated struct with the same name and a smart constructor called
  @tt{make-@emph{id}}.  The struct's "dumb" constructor is hidden so
  that invalid entities cannot be created.

  For every defined field there will be an associated functional
  setter and updater named @tt{set-@emph{id}-@emph{field}} and
  @tt{update-@emph{id}-@emph{field}}, respectively.

  If a @racket[table-name] is provided, then that is used as the name
  for the table.  Otherwise, an "s" is appended to the schema id to
  pluralize it.  Currently, there are no other pluralization rules.

  If @racket[#:virtual] is provided on a schema definition, then the
  resulting schema's entities will not be able to be persisted, nor
  will the schema be registered in the global registry.

  Alternatively, individual fields may be set as @racket[#:virtual].
  Such fields must have a default value defined, and will be ignored
  when performing database operations. @racket[in-entities] will
  produce entities with virtual fields set to their default values.
  Virtual fields may be used for data not directly mapped to database
  columns (see also the @racket[any/f] field type.)

  The @racket[pre-persist-hook] is run before an entity is either
  @racket[insert!]ed or @racket[update!]d.

  The @racket[pre-delete-hook] is run before an entity is
  @racket[delete!]d.

  Hooks @emph{do not} run for arbitrary queries.

  All provided @racket[struct-option]s are passed directly to the
  underlying @racket[struct] definition.

  A syntax error is raised if you declare a field as both a primary
  key and nullable.  Additionally, a syntax error is raised if a
  schema has multiple primary keys.

  Every type has an associated contract so the @racket[#:contract]
  option for fields is only necessary if you want to further restrict
  the values that a field can contain.

  The @racket[#:wrapper] option allows you to supply a function for
  use in normalizing values. The function will be automatically called
  when using a schema’s @tt{make-} or setter functions, and its return
  value is the value that will be stored in the database. A wrapper
  function @emph{cannot} be used to coerce values to the field’s type;
  both the value passed to it and the value it returns must satisfy the
  field’s contract.

  When converting field names to SQL, dashes are replaced with
  underscores and field names that end in question marks drop their
  question mark and are prefixed with @tt{is_}, so that, for example,
  @racket[admin?] becomes @racket[is_admin].

  Custom field names can be specified by providing a @racket[#:name]
  in the field definition.  Note, however, that the library does not
  currently translate between field names and custom column names
  within arbitrary queries.

  @interaction[
    #:eval reference-eval

@subsubsection{Custom Types}
@defmodule[deta/type]

Custom types may be defined using the @racket[define-type] form.

@defform[
 (define-type id
  maybe-fields
  maybe-option ...)
 #:grammar
 [(maybe-fields (code:line)
                (field-id ...))
  (maybe-option (code:line)
                contract-decl
                (code:line #:declaration declaration-expr)
                (code:line #:constructor constructor-expr)
                (code:line #:dump dump-expr)
                (code:line #:load load-expr))
  (contract-decl (code:line #:contract contract-expr)
                 (code:line #:contract-fn contract-fn-expr))]
  #:contracts
  [(contract-expr contract?)
   (contract-fn-expr (-> any/c contract?))
   (declaration-expr (or/c string? (-> any/c symbol? string?)))]]{

  Declares a new field data type.  The data type is named by appending
  @tt{/f} to its @racket[id].  For example, @racket[(define-type
  bigint)] produces @racket[bigint/f].  The type constructor and its
  predicate are automatically provided from the enclosing module.

  The @racket[#:declaration] option controls how the type is rendered
  in schema declarations.  This is the only required option.  The
  associated expression may either a @racket[string?] or a function
  that takes as input the field type and the current dialect.

  The @racket[#:contract] option controls the default contract for
  values of the data type.  The @racket[#:contract-fn] option is
  mutually-exclusive with the @racket[#:contract] option and it can be
  used to parameterize the contract over the type.

  The @racket[#:constructor] option lets you declare a custom
  constructor procedure for instances of the data type.  This is
  useful when declaring parameterized types (such as @racket[array/f]
  or @racket[numeric/f]).

  The @racket[#:dump] option can be used to manipulate values before
  they are passed to the database.  Its associated expression must be
  a procedure of three arguments: the data type, the current dialect
  and the value to dump.

  The @racket[#:load] option can be used to manipulate values before
  they are passed into entities.  It is the dual of @racket[#:dump].

@subsection[#:tag "reflection"]{Reflection}
@defmodule[deta/reflect]

The bindings provided by this module let you access schema and field
metadata at runtime. Before 1.0 is released, I might make breaking
changes to this module. It's unlikely, but it could happen so keep that
in mind!

@defparam[current-schema-registry registry (hash/c symbol? schema?) #:value (make-hasheq)]{
  Holds the current schema registry hash.
}

@defparam[schema-registry-allow-conflicts? allow? boolean? #:value #f]{
  When this parameter is @racket[#f] (the default), registering
  multiple schemas with the same id fails with a user error.  It may
  be useful to set this to @racket[#t] when reloading code with
  @racket[dynamic-rerequire].
}

@defproc[(schema-registry-lookup [id symbol?]) schema?]{
  Returns the schema whose id is @racket[id] from the registry.
  If a schema with the requested id is not registered, an
  @racket[exn:fail:user?] is raised.
}

@defproc[(schema-virtual? [s schema?]) boolean?]{
  Returns @racket[#t] when @racket[s] is a @tech{virtual schema}.
}

@defproc[(schema-fields [s schema?]) (listof field?)]{
  Returns a list of every field defined in @racket[s].
}

@defproc[(schema-table [s schema?]) string?]{
  Returns the name of the table @racket[s] maps to.
}

@defproc[(field? [v any/c]) boolean?]{
  Returns @racket[#t] when @racket[v] is a deta field.
}

@defproc[(field-id [f field?]) symbol?]{
  Returns the Racket name of @racket[f].
}

@defproc[(field-name [f field?]) string?]{
  Returns the name of the database column @racket[f] is associated with.
}

@defproc[(field-type [f field?]) type?]{
  Returns the deta type of @racket[f].
}

@defproc[(type? [v any/c]) boolean?]{
  Returns @racket[#t] when @racket[v] is a deta type.
}

@defproc[(type-declaration [t type?]
                           [dialect (or/c 'postgresql 'sqlite3)]) string?]{
  Returns the DDL type declaration for the type @racket[t] under
  the @racket[dialect] SQL dialect.
}

@bold{Changed:}
@itemlist[
  @item{The @racket[update] form checks that its @tt{column-ids} do
  not contain any periods.  This was previously a source of confusion
  as they were syntactically valid in deta, but not in SQL, and the
  resulting errors made it look like the columns did not exist when
  the problem was actually that SQL assignments must not be qualified.
  Identifiers containing periods are valid in SQL, but are used
  infrequently.  If necessary, we may later add a way to escape such
  identifiers.}
